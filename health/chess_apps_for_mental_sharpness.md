# I am 40 and would like to keep my mind sharp. So would like to play chess daily for 15-20 mins. Which app would you suggest for that? It would be good if I am able to get a rating for my games so that I can track my progress over time.
For a 40-year-old looking to maintain mental sharpness with a 15–20 minute daily habit, there are two primary "industry standard" apps and one specialized "coaching" app that are most effective in 2026. All of these provide ratings to track your progress.

### 1. Chess.com (The Best All-in-One)
This is the most popular choice globally. It is designed to be highly addictive in a productive way, making it easy to maintain a daily habit.
*   **Why it fits 15–20 mins:** You can play one "Rapid" game (10 minutes per side) or complete a series of **Puzzles**. The app also has a "Daily" mode where you make one move every 24 hours, allowing you to have multiple games going in the background.
*   **Tracking Progress:** It provides separate ratings for "Blitz," "Rapid," and "Puzzles." In 2026, it features **AI-driven coaching (powered by Google's DeepMind)** that analyzes your games immediately after you finish and tells you exactly where your logic failed.
*   **Mental Sharpness:** The "Puzzle Rush" feature is excellent for pattern recognition and speed of thought.

### 2. Lichess (The Best Free/Ad-Free Experience)
If you prefer a clean, distraction-free environment, Lichess is the gold standard. It is entirely free and open-source.
*   **Why it fits 15–20 mins:** It has a very fast, "snappy" interface. The **Puzzle Dashboard** is particularly good for mental training; it tracks your performance across different tactical themes (like "forks" or "endgames") so you can see your brain getting better at specific types of logic.
*   **Tracking Progress:** It uses a Glicko-2 rating system which is highly accurate. You can see your rating history in detailed graphs over months or years.
*   **Mental Sharpness:** The "Puzzle Streak" mode challenges you to solve as many puzzles as possible without a single mistake, which is great for building "calculation endurance."

### 3. Learn Chess with Dr. Wolf (The Best for "Coached" Play)
If you are returning to chess after a long break or are a beginner, this app feels more like a private tutor than a game.
*   **Why it fits 15–20 mins:** You play against an AI ("Dr. Wolf") who talks to you during the game. He will stop you and say, *"Wait, that move looks good, but did you see my Bishop?"* 
*   **Tracking Progress:** Dr. Wolf gives you an estimated rating and tracks your "mastery" of specific concepts (like "King Safety" or "Opening Principles").
*   **Mental Sharpness:** It focuses on the "why" behind the moves, which exercises the executive function and logical reasoning parts of the brain.

### Science-Backed Benefits for Age 40+
Research into 2025 and 2026 confirms that chess is one of the most effective "brain gyms" for adults. Unlike static brain-training apps, chess provides **"No Ceiling" training**:
*   **Executive Function:** A 2025 study showed that just 12 weeks of regular chess significantly improved "processing speed" and "attention" in adults.
*   **Neuroplasticity:** Because no two games are the same, your brain is constantly forced to create new synaptic connections rather than just memorizing a pattern.

**Recommendation:** Start with **Chess.com** for the sheer variety of features, or **Lichess** if you want a completely free experience without any "premium" walls. Set a timer for 15 minutes and try to do **5 minutes of puzzles** followed by **one 10-minute game**.
