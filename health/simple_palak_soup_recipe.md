#### **Step-by-Step Recipe:**

**Step 1: Sauté Aromatics and Veggies**
1.  Heat **1 tsp ghee/oil** in a pan or pressure cooker.
2.  Add **garlic, ginger, and green chilli**. Sauté for a minute until the raw smell goes away.
3.  Add the **chopped onions** and sauté until they turn translucent (soft pink).
4.  *If using Potato for thickening:* Add the diced **potato** now and sauté for 2 mins.
    *(If using Besan:* Sprinkle the besan over the onions now and roast for 1 min until aromatic.)

**Step 2: Cook the Spinach**
1.  Add the chopped **Palak (spinach)** and a pinch of salt.
2.  Sauté on medium flame for 2-3 minutes until the leaves wilt and shrink.
3.  Add **1 cup of water**.
    *   *If using a pot:* Cover and cook for 8-10 mins until the potato/spinach is soft.
    *   *If using a pressure cooker:* Pressure cook for 1-2 whistles.

**Step 3: Blend**
1.  Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool down slightly.
2.  Transfer it to a blender/mixer jar.
3.  Blend to a **smooth green puree**. (You don't need to strain it, to keep the fiber intact).

**Step 4: Simmer & Season**
1.  Pour the puree back into the same pan.
2.  Add **½ cup milk** to get a creamy consistency (adjust water if it looks too thick).
3.  Simmer on **low heat** for 3-4 minutes. *Do not boil vigorously after adding milk.*
4.  Add **cumin powder** and **black pepper**. Check salt and adjust.

**Step 5: Final Touch (Important)**
1.  Turn off the flame.
2.  Squeeze **1 tsp lemon juice**. (Vitamin C in lemon helps your body absorb the Iron from spinach).
3.  *Optional Garnish:* A pinch of crushed roasted nuts (like almonds) or a tiny drop of ghee.
