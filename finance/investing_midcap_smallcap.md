# I have some amount which I want to invest in Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund and Axis Smallcamp Fund. I want to put it in a liquid fund and put it in these funds whenever the market is low. How do I determine when to invest and how much to invest in each of these funds? What parameter should I want out for to invest?

Of course. This is an excellent and prudent strategy. Parking your capital in a liquid fund and systematically deploying it into equity funds, especially during market downturns, is a smart way to manage risk and potentially enhance returns. This approach is far superior to investing the entire lump sum at once.

Let's break down your questions into a clear, actionable plan.

### The Core Strategy: "Buy the Dip"

Your strategy is to "buy the dip." The challenge, as you've correctly identified, is defining "the dip." Relying on gut feeling is a recipe for emotional mistakes (i.e., being too scared to invest when the market is crashing, or too eager when it's just a minor blip).

Therefore, you need a **rule-based system**.

### Part 1: How to Determine WHEN to Invest (The Parameters)

Instead of trying to predict the absolute bottom (which is impossible), we will use specific, measurable indicators to identify opportune moments. Here are the most effective parameters for a retail investor to track:

#### Parameter 1: Market Correction from the All-Time High (Most Recommended)

This is the simplest and most effective method. You track the benchmark indices for your chosen funds and invest when they fall by a certain percentage from their most recent peak.

*   **For Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund:** Track the **Nifty Midcap 150 Index**.
*   **For Axis Small Cap Fund:** Track the **Nifty Smallcap 250 Index**.
*   You can also watch the **Nifty 50** for a general sense of the overall market sentiment.

**Actionable Rule-Based Plan:**

Divide your investment into tranches (parts) and deploy them as the market falls.

*   **Minor Dip (5-7% fall from peak):** This happens frequently. You can choose to start deploying a small portion here or wait for a bigger fall.
*   **Correction (10-15% fall from peak):** This is a significant and healthy correction. It's a very good time to deploy a substantial tranche of your capital.
*   **Deep Correction / Bear Market (20%+ fall from peak):** This is a rare opportunity. When fear is at its peak, valuations become very attractive. You should deploy your largest tranches here.

**Example Tranche Plan:**
Let's say you decide to deploy your capital in 5 tranches of ₹10 lakhs each.
*   **Tranche 1 (₹10 L):** Invest when the Nifty Midcap 150 or Nifty Smallcap 250 is **10% down** from its all-time high.
*   **Tranche 2 (₹10 L):** Invest when the index is **15% down**.
*   **Tranche 3 (₹10 L):** Invest when the index is **20% down**.
*   **Tranche 4 (₹10 L):** Invest when the index is **25% down**.
*   **Tranche 5 (₹10 L):** Keep this as a reserve for an unexpected, deeper crash (30%+).

#### Parameter 2: Moving Averages

This is a slightly more technical but very useful indicator. You would look at the 200-Day Moving Average (200-DMA) of the indices. The 200-DMA represents the long-term trend of the market.

*   **The Rule:** A good time to invest is when the index (e.g., Nifty Midcap 150) falls significantly **below its 200-DMA**. This indicates that the market is in a downtrend and prices are likely cheaper than their long-term average.

### The Problem with Waiting: Opportunity Cost

What if the market doesn't fall by 10% for the next two years and keeps rising? Your ₹50 lakhs would be sitting in a liquid fund earning 6-7%, while you miss out on potentially significant equity gains. This is called **opportunity cost**.

To solve this, the best approach is a **Hybrid Strategy**.

### The Recommended Hybrid Strategy: STP with a "Booster"

This combines the discipline of systematic investing with the opportunism of buying the dip.

1.  **Systematic Transfer Plan (STP):** This is the foundation. You automate a fixed amount to be transferred from your liquid fund to the equity funds every week or month. This ensures your money is consistently being put to work, averaging out your purchase price (Rupee Cost Averaging).
2.  **Booster Investment:** You keep a portion of your capital aside specifically to invest manually when the market hits your pre-defined dip triggers (e.g., a 10% or 15% correction).

**A Practical Hybrid Plan for your ₹50 Lakhs:**

*   **STP Corpus:** Allocate **₹35 lakhs** for a regular STP.
*   **Booster Corpus:** Keep **₹15 lakhs** as your "opportunity fund" to deploy during market dips.

**Execution:**
*   **STP:** Set up a weekly or monthly STP of a fixed amount for 12-18 months. For example, a ₹2 lakh monthly STP would deploy ₹24 lakhs in a year. This gets your money into the market regardless of whether a big dip happens or not.
*   **Booster:** Watch the indices. If the Nifty Midcap 150 falls 12%, you can manually invest ₹5 lakhs from your booster corpus. If it falls to 20%, you invest another ₹5-10 lakhs.

### Part 2: How Much to Invest in Each Fund?

This depends entirely on your **risk appetite** and **investment horizon**. Both funds are excellent, but they belong to different risk categories.

*   **Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund:** Invests in mid-sized companies. High growth potential, but less volatile than small caps.
*   **Axis Small Cap Fund:** Invests in small-sized companies. Highest growth potential, but also the highest volatility and risk.

Here are three potential allocation strategies:

1.  **Moderate-Aggressive (Recommended):**
    *   **Motilal Midcap:** 60% (₹30 Lakhs)
    *   **Axis Small Cap:** 40% (₹20 Lakhs)
    *   *Rationale:* A larger base in the relatively more stable mid-cap space, with a significant allocation to small caps for that extra growth potential.

2.  **Aggressive:**
    *   **Motilal Midcap:** 50% (₹25 Lakhs)
    *   **Axis Small Cap:** 50% (₹25 Lakhs)
    *   *Rationale:* An equal-weight approach for someone who is comfortable with high volatility and has a very long investment horizon (10+ years).

3.  **Very Aggressive:**
    *   **Motilal Midcap:** 40% (₹20 Lakhs)
    *   **Axis Small Cap:** 60% (₹30 Lakhs)
    *   *Rationale:* For experienced investors who understand the sharp drawdowns that small caps can experience and have the conviction to hold through them.

### Your Step-by-Step Action Plan

1.  **Choose Your Allocation:** Decide on your risk profile (e.g., 60% Midcap, 40% Smallcap).
2.  **Park the Funds:** Invest the entire **₹50 lakhs** into a good quality Liquid Fund. (e.g., Parag Parikh Liquid Fund, Axis Liquid Fund, etc.). This money will earn you a better return than a savings account while you wait.
3.  **Set Up the STP:** From the liquid fund, set up a weekly or monthly STP into the two equity funds as per your chosen allocation.
    *   *Example:* For a ₹2 Lakh monthly STP with a 60:40 allocation:
        *   ₹1,20,000/month goes to Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund.
        *   ₹80,000/month goes to Axis Small Cap Fund.
    *   Choose a deployment period you are comfortable with (12, 18, or 24 months). A longer period reduces risk further.
4.  **Define and Write Down Your "Booster" Rules:**
    *   "I will invest ₹5 lakhs from my booster corpus when the Nifty Midcap 150 is 12% down from its peak."
    *   "I will invest another ₹5 lakhs when it is 20% down."
    *   *Writing it down prevents emotional decision-making.*
5.  **Monitor and Be Patient:** Track the indices weekly. You can use websites like Moneycontrol, NSE India, or your brokerage's app to set alerts for index levels. Don't get impatient if the market doesn't fall. Your STP is working for you.

**Important Final Considerations:**

*   **Investment Horizon:** This strategy is only suitable for a long-term horizon of **at least 7-10 years**. Mid and small caps are volatile and need time to perform.
*   **Taxation:** Each STP installment is treated as a withdrawal (sale) from your liquid fund and a purchase in your equity fund. The gains you make in the liquid fund will be taxed as per your income tax slab.
*   **Review:** Review your portfolio once a year, but do not panic and stop your plan during a downturn. That is precisely when your strategy provides the most value.

By following this hybrid, rule-based approach, you remove emotion and guesswork, ensuring your money is deployed intelligently and systematically.
