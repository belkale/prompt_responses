# What are the best mutual funds to invest for global exposure? I am investing for the long term and main purpose of global exposure is diversification. I have 60:10:30 indian equity:foreign equity:debt allocation plan. So basically I want to invest 10% of my money in foreign equity.

As of early 2026, investing in international mutual funds in India is slightly complex due to regulatory limits imposed by SEBI/RBI on overseas investments. Many popular funds pause and resume subscriptions based on available "headroom" in the industry-wide limit.

To meet your goal of **10% global diversification** with a long-term view, here is the best strategy and list of funds currently suitable for your 60:10:30 allocation plan.

### **Current Investment Status (February 2026)**
*   **Direct Mutual Funds:** Many schemes that invest directly in foreign stocks (like most S&P 500 index funds) face intermittent suspensions.
*   **Fund of Funds (FoFs) & ETFs:** Schemes that invest in **foreign ETFs** have a separate limit and are generally more accessible.
*   **Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs):** These are the most reliable option right now. They are listed on the stock exchange (NSE/BSE) and can be bought/sold anytime through a demat account, bypassing the subscription restrictions that affect mutual funds.

### **Top Recommendations for Global Exposure**

Since your goal is **diversification** (not just chasing US Tech returns), you should look beyond just the Nasdaq 100.

#### **1. Best for True Global Diversification (Developed + Emerging Markets)**
If you want a single fund that covers the world (US, Europe, Asia), this is your best active fund option.
*   **Fund Name:** **PGIM India Global Equity Opportunities Fund**
    *   **Region:** Global (US, Europe, Japan, etc.)
    *   **Status:** **Open** (Resumed subscriptions as of Feb 6, 2026).
    *   **Why:** Unlike US-centric funds, this invests in the *PGIM Jennison Global Equity Opportunities Fund*, giving you exposure to top companies worldwide (e.g., Nvidia, Eli Lilly, Hermes, MercadoLibre). It is a high-risk, high-reward active fund.

#### **2. Best for US Market Exposure (The Core 10%)**
The US market represents ~60% of the global equity market, so it's a safe proxy for "global" exposure.
*   **Option A (Mutual Fund Route):** **Kotak Nasdaq 100 Fund of Fund**
    *   **Status:** Currently accepting investments (as it invests in an overseas ETF, utilizing the separate $1B limit).
    *   **Why:** Passive tracking of the top 100 non-financial US companies. Good for growth.
*   **Option B (ETF Route - Recommended):** **Motilal Oswal Nasdaq 100 ETF (Symbol: MON100)**
    *   **Status:** Always Buyable (Secondary Market).
    *   **Why:** Highly liquid and bypasses AMC restriction issues.

#### **3. Best for Broader US Exposure (S&P 500)**
If you prefer the S&P 500 (500 companies) over Nasdaq (100 tech-heavy companies) for better diversification:
*   **Fund:** **Mirae Asset S&P 500 Top 50 ETF**
    *   **Status:** Always Buyable on exchange.
    *   **Note:** The *Motilal Oswal S&P 500 Index Fund* (mutual fund) often faces suspension. Checking the "Mirae Asset S&P 500 Top 50 ETF" is a safer bet for consistent investing.

#### **4. Best for Non-US Diversification**
If you want to specifically target Europe or Emerging markets to balance Indian/US volatility:
*   **Edelweiss Europe Dynamic Equity Offshore Fund:** Focuses on European giants (lifestyle, pharma, industrial brands not available in India). Currently open.

---

### **Taxation for FY 2025-26**
International funds are no longer taxed at your slab rate if you hold them long-term. This is a benefit compared to the rules from 2023-2025.
*   **Held for less than 24 months:** Gains are added to your income and taxed at your **Slab Rate**.
*   **Held for more than 24 months:** Gains are taxed at **12.5%** (without indexation).

### **Sample Portfolio for Your 10% Allocation**
For a simple, stress-free execution of your 10% bucket:

| Allocation | Fund Name | Type | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **7%** | **PGIM India Global Equity Opportunities Fund** | Active FoF | True global diversification across geographies. |
| **3%** | **Motilal Oswal Nasdaq 100 ETF** (or Kotak Nasdaq 100 FoF) | ETF / FoF | Concentrated US Tech growth to boost returns. |

**Important Execution Tip:**
Since regulatory limits can change overnight, the **ETF route** (buying like a stock via Demat) is the most permanent solution. If you do not have a Demat account and rely only on SIPs, **PGIM India Global Equity** and **Franklin India Feeder - Franklin US Opportunities** are currently your most stable Mutual Fund choices.

# What if I want to invest in an index or passive fund? What are my best options?

For a passive or index-based approach to global investing, the options in India are slightly more limited due to the regulatory caps, but you can still build a robust "DIY" global portfolio.

Since there is no single **"All Country World Index" (ACWI)** passive fund currently available to Indian retail investors, the best strategy is to combine a **US-focused ETF** (which covers ~60% of the world market) with a **Non-US fund**.

Here is the best passive investment plan for your **10% global allocation**:

### **Option 1: The "DIY" Global Passive Portfolio (Recommended)**
This strategy splits your 10% allocation into two parts to cover the entire developed world.

| Component | Allocation | Recommended Fund/ETF | Why this fund? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **US Market** (The Core) | **70%** (of the 10%) | **Motilal Oswal Nasdaq 100 ETF (MON100)** <br> *Type: ETF (Demat required)* | This acts as your growth engine. It tracks the top 100 non-financial US companies (Apple, Microsoft, Google). Since it's an ETF, you can buy/sell it anytime without worrying about mutual fund subscription limits. |
| **Ex-US Market** (Rest of World) | **30%** (of the 10%) | **Motilal Oswal Developed Market Ex US ETFs FoF** <br> *Type: Fund of Fund* | This fund specifically invests in developed markets *outside* the US (Europe, Japan, Canada), balancing out the US-heavy tech exposure. |

> **Note:** If you prefer the broader **S&P 500** (500 companies) over the Nasdaq 100, use the **Mirae Asset S&P 500 Top 50 ETF** or check if your platform allows lumpsum investments in the **Motilal Oswal S&P 500 Index Fund**.

### **Option 2: Broadest Single US Passive Fund**
If you want the simplest single passive fund that covers the maximum number of companies (Small, Mid, and Large cap) in the US:
*   **Fund Name:** **Navi US Total Stock Market Fund of Fund**
*   **Benchmark:** CRSP US Total Market Index (Invests in Vanguard VTI).
*   **Status:** **Check Availability.** Some platforms show "Invest Now" while others show restricted. If available, this is an excellent low-cost option that covers 100% of the US investable market, not just the top 100/500 companies.

### **Important: ETF vs. Fund of Funds**
Given the regulatory uncertainty, **ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)** are safer for long-term continuity.
*   **Mutual Funds (FoFs)** rely on the fund house having "quota" to send money abroad. If the industry limit is hit, they stop taking your SIPs.
*   **ETFs** (like MON100) are traded between investors on the stock exchange. They rarely stop trading, ensuring you can always invest or withdraw.

### **Taxation for Passive International Funds (FY 2025-26)**
The taxation rules have been updated and are now more favorable for long-term holding than they were in 2023-24.

*   **Held < 24 Months (Short Term):** Gains are added to your income and taxed at your **Slab Rate**.
*   **Held > 24 Months (Long Term):** Gains are taxed at **12.5%** (No indexation benefit).
    *   *Note:* International equity funds are generally treated as "Non-Equity" for tax purposes but usually qualify for the 12.5% rate after 2 years under the new rules (unlike pure Debt funds).

### **Summary of Action Plan**
1.  **Open a Demat Account** (if you haven't already) to access ETFs.
2.  **Buy `MON100` (Motilal Nasdaq 100 ETF)** for your core US exposure.
3.  **Start an SIP** in **Motilal Oswal Developed Market Ex US ETFs FoF** for non-US exposure.
4.  **Ignore** "Global" thematic funds (like AI, Power, etc.) if your goal is pure diversification. Stick to broad indices.
